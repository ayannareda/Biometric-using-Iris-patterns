# Biometric-using-Iris-patterns
Iris recognition is an automated method of biometric identification that uses mathematical pattern-recognition techniques on video images of one or both of the irises of an individual's eyes, whose complex patterns are unique, stable, and can be seen from some distance.

Procedure :-
1. Load the Dataset you want to enroll using Loading_Dataset.ipynb
2. Enroll the iris using Enrolling.ipynb
3. Compare codes using Recognition.ipynb

Methedology :-

For sample pupose, used "UTIRIS V.1" dataset
You can download it form (https://utiris.wordpress.com/)
Below is the sample
